## Key Features and Benefits

This JOSM style replicates the visual elements of Trailmap.fi, such as color-coded trail difficulty levels ja trail visibility. In addition to mimicking the visual style, this JOSM style includes extra features not found on Trailmap.fi, such as the uphill difficulty scale, text labels for MTB difficulty, and surface information. These enhancements offer additional functionality for users to visualize more detailed aspects of trail data, providing a comprehensive view of the trail conditions. 

### MTB Difficulty Scale
Color-coded indicators based on the `mtb:scale` tag, which rates trails on a scale from 0 to 6. This scale indicates how difficult the trail is to ride, with 0 being the easiest and 6 being the most challenging. This helps in distinguishing trails by their difficulty levels at a glance. [Learn more about the `mtb:scale` tag on the OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale).

## Project Background

As an OSM contributor since 2010, I have focused on mapping natural features and trails suitable for mountain biking. My passion for outdoor activities such as mountain biking, gravel riding, road cycling, canoeing, and general nature exploration has deeply influenced my contributions. I am also an enthusiastic map researcher and editor. Combining my love for the outdoors with mapping has made it clear that there is a need for better tools to visualize and edit trail data.

Finally in 2024, I recognized the need for a tool to better visualize MTB trail data in JOSM. Despite JOSM being a powerful editor, it can be challenging to get a clear overview of trail conditions and difficulty without switching between different map layers or external services that can visualize trail data.

Inspired by the detailed and user-friendly visual style of Trailmap.fi, I embarked on a project to create a similar style for JOSM. The goal was to bring the clarity and detail of Trailmap.fi into the JOSM environment, making it easier for contributors to see how their edits would appear on MTB-focused platforms. This project was my first attempt at using the MapCSS language, which presented its own set of challenges due to its complexity and lack of comprehensive documentation. Despite these hurdles, I was determined to create a useful tool for the mapping community.

The development process involved carefully examining maps on Trailmap.fi and manually translating what I observed into MapCSS. I did not have access to Trailmap.fi’s code or any automated tools to assist in this process. Instead, it was a meticulous task of visual inspection and manual coding to ensure that the style closely matched the appearance of Trailmap.fi. This approach means that while the style aims to replicate the visual elements of Trailmap.fi, it is not an exact copy, and some elements may look different.

The main objective of this style is to provide immediate visual feedback on map edits within JOSM, ensuring the accurate representation of trail data. This MTB Trailmap Style includes features such as color-coded trail difficulty levels, indicators for uphill difficulty, text labels for MTB difficulty and surface information, and visualization of trail width and visibility. These enhancements offer a comprehensive view of trail conditions directly within JOSM, streamlining the mapping process and improving accuracy for MTB mapping platforms like Trailmap.fi, MTBmap.no, and other MTB mapping services that utilize similar OSM data.

By using this map style, map editors can see real-time previews of their edits, eliminating the need to wait for updates on external services, which can take hours or even days. This makes the tool invaluable for anyone involved in mapping MTB trails, ensuring that edits are consistent and accurately reflected across different platforms. Its global applicability means it can benefit MTB mapping efforts worldwide, supporting various platforms and communities dedicated to mountain biking.

>[!CAUTION]
>This style is not an exact copy of Trailmap.fi nor based on their code. It has been developed through visual inspection to closely match its appearance. While some elements may be rendered differently, the primary objective is to offer a helpful tool for OSM map editors using JOSM to better visualize their contributions. Users should not expect a perfect one-to-one replication, but rather a practical and useful representation for map editing purposes. Not all elements from Trailmap.fi are rendered the same way. The focus has been on ensuring that mtb:scale is displayed accurately, while trail visibility and trail width are approximations. Additional features such as mtb:scale:uphill, trail surface information and text labels for trails have been added, which are not found in Trailmap.fi.

## Visual Guide

### MTB Difficulty Scale

Paths are color-coded based on their MTB difficulty scale, making it easy to distinguish trails at a glance. More information on MTB difficulty can be found on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale) and the [Trailmap tag wiki](https://wiki.trailmap.fi/fi/kartoitus/tagit):
- `mtb:scale=0-`: Light Blue `#50d6eb` - **Very Easy Path**: Smooth outdoor paths and forest roads, etc. Does not require any off-road skills and can be ridden with a city bike or road bike.
- `mtb:scale=0`: Green `#75df08` - **Easy Path**: Needle-covered path or similar smooth easy track, with few stones or roots. Does not require special off-road skills, pleasant even for beginners, and can be easily ridden with a cyclocross bike.
- `mtb:scale=1`: Yellow `#d8dc00` - **Intermediate Path**: Small stones or roots. Obstacles can mainly be crossed with a mountain bike without bypassing. Mostly easy to ride with basic skills on a mountain bike, but a beginner may occasionally need to dismount. Still rideable with a cyclocross bike for a skilled rider.
- `mtb:scale=2`: Orange `#feb13e` - **Difficult Path**: Larger stones and roots. There may be smaller drops. Requires concentration even from more experienced riders and is not easy for most, especially uphill and when wet. Cyclocross bike needs to be carried on the shoulder.
- `mtb:scale=3`: Red `#ff4355` - **Very Difficult Path**: Many large stones, roots, and other obstacles. Large drops and challenging climbs. Almost impossible to ride uphill. Requires tight concentration from experienced riders and is slow to ride. Beginners often need to push their bikes frequently.
- `mtb:scale=4`: Magenta `#e410dd` - **Extremely Difficult Path**: Extremely difficult due to large obstacles and height differences, requires exceptional trials-type skills to ride even very slowly. Very slow to run for trail runners as well.
- `mtb:scale=5`: Purple `#9600c8` - **Almost Impossible Path**: Practically unridable for almost everyone due to large obstacles, height differences, and winding paths. Theoretically rideable with sufficient skills.
- `mtb:scale=6`: Dark Purple `#8101ad` - **Unridable Path**: Not rideable regardless of skills due to, for example, long vertical drops or large, densely located obstacles. Requires concentration even on foot.

### MTB Difficulty Scale Uphill

Paths are color-coded based on their MTB uphill difficulty scale, displayed as a secondary line next to the path. More information on MTB uphill difficulty can be found on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale:uphill):

- `mtb:scale:uphill=0`: Green `#75df08` - **Easy Uphill**: Graveled or hardened earth with good grip, typically a highway=track. Even unskilled mountain bikers can easily ride up these paths. Average incline is less than 10%, with a maximum incline of less than 15%. There are no obstacles.
- `mtb:scale:uphill=1`: Yellow `#d8dc00` - **Moderate Uphill**: Similar to easy uphill but slightly steeper. The path is gravel or hardened earth, with good grip to prevent wheelspin. Average incline is less than 15%, with a maximum incline of less than 20%. Some loose objects may be present but are avoidable.
- `mtb:scale:uphill=2`: Orange `#feb13e` - **Challenging Uphill**: The path is mostly stable but unsurfaced and partly washed out. Requires steady pedaling and balance. Average incline is less than 20%, with a maximum incline of less than 25%. Expect fist-sized loose rocks, roots, or a rocky underground.
- `mtb:scale:uphill=3`: Red `#ff4355` - **Difficult Uphill**: The surface varies with tight corners and small steps, composed of rocks, earth, or grass. Very good balance and steady pedaling are needed. Without advanced skills, mountain bikers will need to push their bike. Average incline is less than 25%, with a maximum incline of less than 30%. Contains fist-sized loose rocks, roots, and branches or a rocky surface.
- `mtb:scale:uphill=4`: Magenta `#e410dd` - **Very Difficult Uphill**: Very steep or in poor condition for pedaling. Features steps, trees, roots, and tight corners. Even skilled and strong mountain bikers will have to push or carry their bike for parts of the way. Average incline is less than 30%, with a maximum incline of less than 40%. Expect big loose rocks, big branches across the trail, and a rocky or loose surface.
- `mtb:scale:uphill=5`: Purple `#8101ad` - **Extremely Difficult Uphill**: Too steep and/or difficult to ride uphill. This level indicates to other mountain bikers that they will need to push and carry their bike on this part of the trail.

### Path Visibility Based Styles

Paths with varying visibility are displayed with different dash patterns and opacity levels. More information can be found on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:trail_visibility):

- `trail_visibility=bad`: Poor visibility, difficult to follow, also with a short dash pattern of 2 pixels followed by a gap of 2 pixels.
- `trail_visibility=horrible`: Very poor visibility, very difficult to follow, with the same short dash pattern of 2 pixels followed by a gap of 2 pixels.
- `trail_visibility=no`: No visible path, extremely challenging, with a short dash pattern of 2 pixels followed by a gap of 2 pixels.

### Path Width

Paths are displayed with varying widths based on their `width` tag, including casing. More information can be found on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width):

- `width < 0.6`: Narrow paths displayed with a total width (including casing) of 6 pixels (2 pixels for the path, 2 pixels for the casing on each side).
- `width < 0.9`: Slightly wider paths displayed with a total width (including casing) of 8 pixels (2 pixels for the path, 2 pixels for the casing on each side).
- `width < 1.8`: Moderately wide paths displayed with a total width (including casing) of 12 pixels (3 pixels for the path, 4.5 pixels for the casing on each side).
- `width > 1.8`: Wide paths displayed with a total width (including casing) of 14 pixels (4 pixels for the path, 5 pixels for the casing on each side).

### Access Restrictions

Paths with restricted access are displayed with red color and specific dash patterns. More information can be found on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access):
- `bicycle=no`, `bicycle=private`, `access=no`, `access=private`: No bicycle access or private access. Dash pattern `4, 4`.
