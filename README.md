# MTB Trailmap - Map Style for JOSM
*Easily visualize path or trail difficulty, uphill difficulty, trail width, visibility, and surface type while editing maps with JOSM editor. Inspired by the popular Trailmap map service, this style enhances your mapping experience by providing clear, color-coded indicators and text labels for various trail attributes, helping you make accurate and detailed edits.*

## Introduction

The Trailmap Inspired Style for JOSM brings the look and feel of the popular [Trailmap.fi](https://web.trailmap.fi) map service into the JOSM editor. This style is particularly beneficial for users, especially in Finland, who frequently contribute to OpenStreetMap (OSM) and want to ensure their updates will reflect accurately on the Trailmap platform. By replicating the visual style of Trailmap, users can immediately see how their edits and updates will appear, maintaining consistency and accuracy in map data.

While this style draws heavy inspiration from Trailmap.fi, it is important to note that it is not an exact copy nor created based on their code. All visual aspects have been approximated through visual inspection to best match the appearance of Trailmap.fi. Consequently, certain elements may be rendered differently, and users should not expect a perfect one-to-one replication. Despite these differences, this style aims to provide a close approximation that will be helpful for many map editors.

In addition to mimicking the visual style, this JOSM style includes extra features not found on Trailmap.fi, such as the uphill difficulty scale, text labels for MTB difficulty, and surface information. These enhancements offer additional functionality for users to visualize more detailed aspects of trail data, providing a comprehensive view of the trail conditions.

This style is designed to work seamlessly with JOSM's default styles, such as the [JOSM Standard](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/browser/trunk/resources/styles/standard/elemstyles.mapcss) and [Potlatch 2](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles/Potlatch2) styles, ensuring it can be used alongside other popular styles without conflicts.

### Purpose and Benefits

The primary purpose of this style is to provide a familiar visual environment for Trailmap users within JOSM. It helps users to:

- **Visualize the MTB difficulty scale of trails**: Easily distinguish trails by their difficulty levels using color-coded indicators.
- **Identify access restrictions and obstacles**: Quickly recognize paths with restricted access or potential obstacles.
- **See trail visibility and width variations**: Understand the visibility and width of trails at a glance with varied dash patterns and opacities.
- **Utilize customizable settings for a tailored mapping experience**: Adjust the display of various trail attributes to suit individual mapping needs, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Surface Information**: Display detailed surface type information directly on the paths, aiding in better trail assessment and editing decisions.

### Key Features

- **MTB Difficulty Scale**: Indicates MTB difficulty scale with color coding, making it easy to distinguish trails at a glance.
- **MTB Difficulty Scale Uphill**: Displays a secondary line next to the path for the uphill difficulty scale, providing detailed information for mountain bikers.
- **Text Display**: Shows text labels next to paths for MTB difficulty scale and uphill difficulty scale, providing clear, on-map information about trail difficulty.
- **Surface Information**: Displays paths' and trails' surface information with color coding and text labels next to paths, indicating the type of surface (e.g., paved, gravel, dirt).
- **Toggle Options**: Users can easily toggle the visibility of various elements such as the MTB difficulty scale, uphill difficulty scale, and surface information, allowing for a cleaner map view based on individual preferences.
- **Compatibility**: This style is designed to work seamlessly with JOSM's default styles, such as the [JOSM Standard](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/browser/trunk/resources/styles/standard/elemstyles.mapcss) and [Potlatch 2](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles/Potlatch2) styles, ensuring it can be used alongside other popular styles without conflicts.
- **Access Restrictions**: Visually indicates paths with restricted access, such as those that are private, permissive, or not accessible to bicycles, helping users quickly identify paths with access limitations.

## Usage

### Toggle Options in JOSM

(images/JOSM-style-trailmap.jpg)

This style includes settings that allow you to toggle the visibility of certain elements such as the MTB difficulty scale, uphill difficulty scale, and surface information. To access and modify these settings:

1. Open JOSM editor.
2. Load the style by following the installation instructions.
3. Go to `View` > `Map Paint Styles`.
4. In the Map Paint Styles panel, find the Trailmap Inspired Style.
5. Click on the wrench icon next to the style name to open the style settings.
6. Here, you can see various toggle options:
- **Display MTB Difficulty Scale**: Toggle the display of MTB difficulty scale color coding on paths.
- **Text for MTB Difficulty**: Toggle the display of MTB difficulty scale text over the paths.
- **Display MTB Uphill Difficulty Scale**: Toggle the display of MTB uphill difficulty scale color coding next to the paths.
- **Text for MTB Uphill Difficulty**: Toggle the display of MTB uphill difficulty scale text next to the paths.
- **Display surface on a separate path**: Toggle the display of surface information on a separate path layer next to the paths.
- **Display surface on paths**: Toggle the display of surface information directly on the paths. Note that the surface coloring can't be seen if the MTB Difficulty Scale option is enabled.
- **Text for surface**: Toggle the display of surface type text next to the paths.
- **Display path opacity**: Toggle path opacity based on trail visibility.

By default, all these options are enabled except `Display surface on a separate path`. You can disable any of these options based on your preference.

## Visual Guide

### MTB Difficulty Scale

Paths are color-coded based on their MTB difficulty scale:
- `mtb:scale=0-`: Light Blue `#50d6eb`
- `mtb:scale=0`: Green `#75df08`
- `mtb:scale=1`: Yellow `#d8dc00`
- `mtb:scale=2`: Orange `#feb13e`
- `mtb:scale=3`: Red `#ff4355`
- `mtb:scale=4`: Magenta `#e410dd`
- `mtb:scale=5`: Purple `#9600c8`
- `mtb:scale=6`: Dark Purple `#8101ad`

### MTB Difficulty Scale Uphill

Paths are color-coded based on their MTB uphill difficulty scale, displayed as a secondary line next to the path:
- `mtb:scale:uphill=0`: Green `#75df08`
- `mtb:scale:uphill=1`: Yellow `#d8dc00`
